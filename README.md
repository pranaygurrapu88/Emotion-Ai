# Emotion-Ai

The aim of the project is to classify peopleâ€™s Emotion based on their Face images like Happy, Sad, Angar, Surprised and Disgust using different features. To solve this problem, I have used Convolution Neural Network and Residual Block to predict facial key-points. Images consist of only one color channel (grey-scale images).
